# UntitledGame

I began working on this project during the summer of 2017. I spent a year on and off learning how to build a web-based 3D video game using [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). After graduating in the spring of 2018 I spent the next 6 months building an Augmented Reality sandbox and the system that would allow it to interface with the game I had created. The final result of my work is essentially a proof of concept. The game is simplistic and turning it into something fully fledge would require time and a team.
